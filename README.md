# Statcast Homerun Analysis
## Data Source 
The datasets were obtained from [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/).

## Data Description
There are 2 csv files, one for Giancarlo Stanton and one for Aaron Judge. The dataset contains statistics that were obtained from Statcast regarding home runs such as launch speed, launch angle, and where in the strikezone the ball was hit. Statcast collects data using high-resolution optical cameras along with radar equipment that has been installed in all 30 Major League ballparks since 2015. The technology tracks the location and movements of the ball and every player on the field at any given time. 

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to understand the dataset, and compare 2 great sluggers and look for similarities and differences in their homeruns and hitting styles and preferences.
