# Statcast Homerun Analysis

## Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

## Data Source 
The datasets were obtained from [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/).

## Data Description
There are 2 csv files, one for Giancarlo Stanton and one for Aaron Judge. The dataset contains statistics that were obtained from Statcast regarding home runs such as launch speed, launch angle, and where in the strikezone the ball was hit. Statcast collects data using high-resolution optical cameras along with radar equipment that has been installed in all 30 Major League ballparks since 2015. The technology tracks the location and movements of the ball and every player on the field at any given time. 

## Project Goal
The goal of the project is to understand the dataset, and compare 2 great sluggers and look for similarities and differences in their homeruns and hitting styles and preferences.

## Conclusion
4 different statistics were compared in the analysis.
* Launch Speed
* Launch Angle
* Pitch Velocity
* Strikezone

Even though both hitters had very similar homerun numbers their hitting profiles are completely different. Aaron Judge's homeruns generally have a higher launch speed and lower launch angle than Giancarlo Stanton's homeruns. On average, Aaron Judge also hits homeruns on faster pitches than Stanton does. Like most great power hitters, both players hit a lot of homeruns on pitches in the center of the strikezone. Judge is least likely to hit a home run on pitches high and away while Stanton does not hit many home runs low and away. Regardless, I would not want to pitch against either of these hitters.
